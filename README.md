# A simple Blog with a Poll, made with Laravel, Vue.js and Tailwind

A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is an informational website consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page.

## Getting Started

Create a new Laravel application, configure your database, and run your database migrations. Once you have created a new Laravel application, you may install Laravel Breeze using Composer:

   ```sh
   composer require laravel/breeze --dev
   ```
After Composer has installed the Laravel Breeze package, you may run the breeze:install Artisan command. 
   ```sh
    php artisan breeze:install
    php artisan migrate
    npm install
    npm run dev
   ```
